# RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis and Variant Calling

This repository hosts scripts for differential expression and variant calling analysis of high throughput sequencing data.

##cummeRbund 
*cummeRbund: An R package for exploration, analysis, manipulation,and visualization of Cufflinks high-throughput RNA Sequencing data.*

##DESeq2 
*DESeq2: An R package for differential expression analysis. DESEq2 estimates variance-mean dependence in count data (from HTseq-count output) from high-throughput sequencing assays and test for differential expression based on a model using the negative binomial distribution.*
